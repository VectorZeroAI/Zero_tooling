# Zero_tooling
A Public Repo, for userfull Tools, as my commitment to this Community. 

The ZeroSearch uses the Brave API, If Not specified what API it uses in the Name.
Config File is one for all of the Search engines, but you don't need to fill all of the Keys in If you don't use all of the ZeroSearch Versions.

OpenRouter API Key is required for the ZeroSearch to Work, because it uses LLM from OpenRouter to compile the Report for you.
