# Zero tooling
A Public Repo, for userfull Tools, as my commitment to this Community. 

ZeroSearch is using OpenRouter LLM and Google 
Custom Search to provide you with direct 
reports to a theme.

You would need to input your API key and CSE ID.
To get these, google "Google Custom Search" or
"Google Programmable Search", and register 
your API key and your CSE there, and then 
Extract Your CSE ID from the code block shown
down there, use an AI like ChatGPT to do that
if you cant do that alone, LLMs can reliebly 
do that for you.

OpenRouter API Key is required for the 
ZeroSearch to Work, because it uses LLM from 
OpenRouter to compile the Report for you.

To get OpenRouter API key, go to "OpenRouter" 
website, then to "Keys", and then just create
your.
